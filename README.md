# Earthquake Visualization Challenge

## Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is dedicated to providing valuable scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystem health, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. To enhance public understanding and support decision-making, USGS seeks innovative tools to visualize vast amounts of global earthquake data effectively.

## Project Objective
Develop a visualization tool that leverages USGS earthquake data to inform and educate the public and governmental organizations. This tool aims to facilitate better understanding and potentially aid in securing additional funding for further research and response strategies.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Visualization Skills**: Improved understanding and ability to create dynamic data visualizations with Leaflet.js.
- **API Integration**: Gained proficiency in integrating and parsing real-time data feeds from USGS using their GeoJSON API.
- **Interactive Elements**: Learned to enhance user interaction through informative pop-ups and a comprehensive legend that aids in data interpretation.
- **Problem Solving**: Developed problem-solving skills in adapting visualization tools to represent complex data sets effectively.


## Tools and Libraries
- **Leaflet.js**: For creating interactive maps.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: For frontend development.
- **USGS GeoJSON API**: Source for real-time earthquake data.

## Acknowledgments
- USGS for providing the earthquake data.
- The Leaflet.js team for their excellent mapping tools.
